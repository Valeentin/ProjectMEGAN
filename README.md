## The MEGAN Protocol

Source code for the MEGAN protocol. The python scripts are designed to work on any machine. If the UUID addresses have changed or a "Connection Error!" appears, try scanning for all BLE devices to find the Arduino.

C code is designed to run on an Arduino Nano BLE Sense Rev 2.
